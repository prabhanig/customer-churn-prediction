# Customer Churn Prediction and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning and visualizing key insights to aid business decision-making. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and prediction while emphasizing reproducibility and scalability.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning**: Cleans and preprocesses the dataset to handle missing values and encode categorical data.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to predict customer churn.
- **Prediction**: Provides a framework for making churn predictions on new data.
- **Visualization**: Offers insights into customer churn via tools like Power BI.

## Dataset
We use the **Telco Customer Churn** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), which includes customer information such as demographics, account details, and churn status.

- **File**: `data/customer_data.csv`
- **Target Variable**: `Churn` (Yes/No)

## Prerequisites
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

Install required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run the Project
### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine or Google Colab:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

### 2. Data Cleaning
Run the `data_cleaning.py` script to preprocess the dataset:
```bash
python src/data_cleaning.py
```
**Output**: `data/cleaned_data.csv`

### 3. Model Training
Run the `train_model.py` script to train the Random Forest model:
```bash
python src/train_model.py
```
**Output**: `model/random_forest_model.pkl`

### 4. Make Predictions
Run the `churn_prediction.py` script to make predictions:
```bash
python src/churn_prediction.py
```
**Output**: `data/predictions.csv`

---

## Visualizations (Optional)
1. Open `data/predictions.csv` in Power BI.
2. Create dashboards to visualize:
   - Churn rates by demographic features.
   - Correlations between features and churn.
3. Save your `.pbix` Power BI file and upload it to the `visualizations/` folder (optional).
